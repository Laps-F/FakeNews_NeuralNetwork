# FakeNews_NeuralNetwork

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a fake news detection project using deep learning neural networks. The project explores various strategies in artificial intelligence, specifically implemented in Python. The goal is to effectively identify and classify fake news within a given dataset, with a focus on evaluating model performance and refining strategies.

## Key Features

1. **Two Neural Network Models:** The repository includes the implementation of two neural network models, each with distinct architectures to compare their effectiveness in fake news detection.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Detailed scripts for training the models on a Kaggle dataset and evaluating their performance on test data. The results of accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics are documented.

3. **Kaggle Dataset:** The Kaggle dataset is specified in the notebook; however, here is the link to the dataset for reference: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/overview)

4. **Experimentation Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks capturing the experimentation process, including data preprocessing, model architecture visualization, and performance analysis.

5. **Collaboration and Interdisciplinary Insights:** The repository emphasizes the importance of collaboration among experts in artificial intelligence, linguistics, and ethics. It provides insights into the interdisciplinary approach to tackle the persistent challenges in fake news detection.

6. **Requirements and Dependencies:** All the necessary libraries for the proper execution of the notebook are specified at the beginning of the file. Please make sure they are installed correctly..

7. **Future Work and Contributions:** A section outlining potential areas for improvement and avenues for further research. Contributors are encouraged to provide feedback, suggest enhancements, or contribute to the project.
